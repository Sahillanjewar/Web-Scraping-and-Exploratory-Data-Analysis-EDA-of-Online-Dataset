# Web-Scraping-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-of-Online-Dataset
This project focuses on collecting real-world data using web scraping techniques and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive meaningful insights. The main goal is to demonstrate how raw unstructured data available on the internet can be transformed into structured datasets for analysis and visualization.
The project is divided into two major parts:

Web Scraping

Extracts data from websites such as product listings, books, movie ratings, or job postings.

Uses Python libraries (BeautifulSoup, Requests, Scrapy) to automate data collection.

Stores the scraped information in a CSV/Excel file for further analysis.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Cleans and preprocesses the scraped data (handling missing values, removing duplicates, formatting).

Applies descriptive statistics to understand data distribution.

Uses visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to identify patterns, correlations, and trends.

Generates insights like price distribution, rating trends, or category analysis.

This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a data analytics pipelineâ€”from data collection â†’ cleaning â†’ analysis â†’ visualization â†’ insights.
2. Objective

To extract real-world data from websites using web scraping techniques.

To clean, preprocess, and analyze the scraped dataset.

To generate insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.

To visualize patterns, correlations, and distributions for better decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Tools & Libraries

Python

BeautifulSoup / Scrapy / Requests (for web scraping)

Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn / Plotly (for data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (IDE for analysis)

ðŸ”¹ 4. Methodology
Step 1: Web Scraping

Select a website (example: Books data, Flipkart product prices, IMDB movie ratings, or job postings).

Extract required fields (e.g., Title, Price, Rating, Reviews, etc.).

Store the scraped data in CSV/Excel format.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values.

Remove duplicates.

Convert data types (numeric, categorical).

Standardize column names.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, std).

Data distribution plots (histogram, boxplot).

Correlation analysis (heatmap).

Category-wise analysis (bar charts, countplots).

Trend analysis (line chart).

Step 4: Visualization & Insights

Create meaningful plots.

Interpret findings (e.g., "Most expensive category", "Rating vs Price trend").
